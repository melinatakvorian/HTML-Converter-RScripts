# HTML-Converter

This repository has the 3 files that can be used to 'manually' run the converter. 
This means that the user must take the file path to the folder of Word documents, paste it into the indicated part of the script, 
and replace the slashes so that they are all forward slashes.

These scripts are used to form the basis for the Shiny apps that also are converters.
